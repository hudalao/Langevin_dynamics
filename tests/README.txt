Three unit test have been used:

test_input:
estimate if the tran_input_float function works to input the parameters from the input file


test_potential_output_length:
estimate if the arrays storing potential energy and corresponding force have the same length as the space grid 


test_energy_conservation:
setting the damping coefficient to zero, and correspondingly the drag force and solvent force would be zero. Thus,
the energy would be conserved around a value range
